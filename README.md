## The Goal

Analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements that help the viewer visualize the visible trends.

The intent is to create a series of feature stories about the correlation between certain demographic groups and health risks. 

The data set used is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). The current data set incldes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.


### Level 1: D3 Dabbler

Created is a scatter plot that shows the relation between a demographic and a health risk factor.

Using D3 techniques, the scatter plot represents each state with circle elements. The data is pulled in from 'data.csv' and is then reinterpreted into the created visual.

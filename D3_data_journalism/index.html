          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Obesity and Age</h2>
          <p>Using the dataset provided, a few conclusions can be drawn from the comparison of age and obesity percent in each state. As visible in the chart below,
            there's a grouping of states toward the center of the plot: a trend of obesity showing in mid-to-late thirties, at a 30% rate. 
          </p>

          <p>Another, less visible trend, is a slight downward slope in the data. This indicates that states with a higher median age of obese individuals
            have a lower overall obesity percentage. This could simply be a result of states with active youth, but sedentary matured individuals. 
          </p>

          <p>Finally, the empty space within this plot tells a interesting story in itself. Worth noting is the very limited data in early thirties. 
            Only states with 30% and above overall obesity rate show a median age of early thirties, apart from a couple outliers. The story being told here is
          that persons aged 33 and below are either more physically active, have higher metabolism, or eat healthier than their aged counterparts (apart from Utah).</p>
